Implementation of a CSP based cookie switch to forbid loading ANY 3rd party resources without having the consent cookie set.

**This works for any website, any framework and is extremly simple, but yet very effective - no backend implementation needed** 

It will block anything:

 - Google Fonts
 - Recaptcha
 - any non local 3rd party domains like CDNs or similar
 - GA
 - any iframe
 - any external form
 - any external js
 - any external CSS
 
 That means, you are on the safe side until the user accepts your cookie.
